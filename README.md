An exploatory analysis for time series data using econometrics approach

## Outline
**1. The nature of time series data**
 - **Features of time series data** 
   - Time series data & Cross-sectional data
   - Impact Propensity & Long run propensity
   - Trend & Seasonality
   - Stationary & Non-stationary
 - **Visualizing time seires data with Python**
   - Line Plot
   - Hist Plot & Density Plot
   - Box Plot & Violin Plot
   - Heat Map
   - Lag Plot
   - Autocorrelation Plot 

**2. Models for time series analysis**
 - **Stationary univariate time series analysis** 
   - White Noise
   - Autoregressive Model (AR) & Moving Average (MA) Model
   - Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) Model
 - **Non-stationary univariate time series analysis**
   - Unit root test for stationary
   - Autoregressive Integration Moving Average (ARIMA) Model 
 - **Multi-variate time series analysis**
   - Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Model
   - Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Model
   - Vector Error Corrected (VEC) Model

## About this Jupyter Notebook
This note book contains material to help you learn how to unravel data structure when analyzing time series. This notebook and the dataset can be downloaded from Github:

**https://github.com/XiWen0627/ExploringTimeSeriesDataWithPython**

The material are in the /data dictionary.

This notebook was constructed using Anaconda 3.8 Python distribution. If you are not running version Anaconda 3.5 or higher, we suggest you update your Anaconda distribution now. You can download the Python 3 Anaconda distribution for your operating system from the corresponding web site.

## Resources
In this tutorial, we will work with four powerful Python packages: **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Statsmodels** and **Seaborn**. All four packages have extensive online documentation, we have provided the related resources for learning below.
- [**Statsmodels**](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/api.htm)
- [**Visualization with Pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.18.0/visualization.html)
- [**Matplotlib-Visual with Python**](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html)
- [**Seaborn: statistical data visualization**](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
